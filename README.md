PayPal iOS SDK
==============

The PayPal iOS SDK provides a software library that makes it easy for iOS developers
to accept both credit cards and PayPal directly within native mobile apps.

For usage and integration instructions, see the
[PayPal iOS SDK Integration Guide](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/mobile/ios-integration-guide/).

Older libraries
===============

PayPal is replacing the [Mobile Payments Libraries (MPL)](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/classic/mobile/gs_MPL/)
with the iOS/Android SDK. The PayPal iOS/Android SDK is currently available in the US,
with more country support coming soon. US developers should upgrade now for more features
and a better mobile experience. Non-US developers, you can continue to use MPL for the time
being. Issues related to MPL should be filed in the [sdk-packages repo](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-packages/),
not here.

For developers with existing Express Checkout integrations or who want additional
features such as authorization and capture, you may wish to use Mobile Express Checkout
in a webview.
